# Section 0: PREPARING FOR THIS JOURNEY

Section 0 is estimated to take 2-3 hours to complete. Students come to Turing to change their careers, and we will support you through that. Changing careers, especially get that first job in a new field, requires more than the technical skills you'll learn here. So, we have an intentionally designed Career Development curriculum and a team of Career Coaches who will be supporting you, starting in Mod 1.

Participating in Career Development is an expectation for all students as it is just as important as learning the technical skills. There will be times when you are tempted to put this work on the back-burner because you get so deep in the apps you are building, but because we care about you, we will hold you accountable to keeping up with your professional growth as well.

The assignments below will give you an understanding of what type of work and support is to come, and will provide helpful information to your Career Coaches!

## Part A: Career Development Overview

The objective of the Career Development Team is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:

- Networking: Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search
- Interviewing: The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges
- Materials: A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter
Job Search Strategies: A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them
- Negotiations: Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates

You can find all information on the curriculum and job search support [on the Career Development site](https://careerdev.turing.edu/).

### Action Items

1. [Bookmark the Career Development site](https://careerdev.turing.edu/). You will also be able to find this site again from both the [Back End Curriculum site](https://backend.turing.edu/) and the [Front End Curriculum site](https://frontend.turing.edu/). Spend a few minutes browsing around the site and make note of:
- The Career Dev Team mission statement and Team members on the homepage – familiarize yourself with who your coach will be at different points in the program!
- [The Module 1 section](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module_one/index), which includes lessons, activities, and information on your learning goals for Mod 1
- [The Resources section](https://careerdev.turing.edu/resources/index). Here you can find links, videos, and documents to help you with specific areas of support in the job search.
- [The Homeroom Groups](https://careerdev.turing.edu/student_discussion_groups/index) and [Mix It Up](https://careerdev.turing.edu/mixed_groups/index) information. Within your cohort, you’ll be put into a small group to work on PD activities and discussion together as a way to foster collaboration weekly. Twice a mod, you’ll also be put into groups mixed across program and cohorts to meet others in the Turing community and share resources based on specific topics.
- [The Module 5 section](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module-5/index), which covers what job search support looks like once you’ve graduated from Turing.

    - **✅ Done with all of the above!**

1. Reflect on the following questions in the survey you’ll submit:
- How do you feel about the expectations of the professional development curriculum?
    - _I feel excited but nervous about the professional development curriculum. The `Networking` and `Negotiating` parts I am the most nervous about._

- What are you excited about when it comes to professional development?
    - _I'm excited to improve my `Networking` and `Negotiating` skills. Especially, since those are the areas I am most nervous about._

- What are your questions or concerns about these expectations?
    - _My only concern is that I will let my past experiences in the working world cloud my confidence and judgment while choosing a job._

## Part B: Pairin Survey

[One tool we’ll be using for your professional development at Turing is the Pairin Survey](https://www.pairin.com/). This survey measures over 100 coachable and changeable skills. This activity invites you to begin building an understanding of how learning about and developing your strengths applies to your success in your new career. We will discuss the results of this survey more in-depth in your first professional development session at Turing.

### Action Items

1. [Take the survey using this link](https://survey.pairin.com/signup/15960/student). It will prompt you to create an account when you take it. There are 2 sections for this survey:
- First section: Choose adjectives to answer how you currently are - ✅ Done!

- Second section: Choose adjectives to answer how you would like to be. The second section is marked as “optional,” but it is highly recommended that you fill out this section in order to provide more data for you on how you’d like to grow. The survey should take you about 15-20 minutes. - ✅ Done!

2. Download the PDF of your Pairin Top 4 results (or take a screenshot) and include it in your survey submission.
    - _I'm actually very surprised at how accurate my results are after reading them over. It makes sense to me that I ranked lowest on the `Personal` section... 😅 Something I look forward to working on!_


_Optional: To build an understanding of your Pairin results, here are additional resources:_

- [Understanding Your Pairin Results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXe3i_KjaSI) (2 minutes)
- [Pairin Qualities Overview](https://careerdev.turing.edu/files/Pairin%20Top%20Qualities%20Overview.pdf) (2.5 minute read)
- [How the Pairin Survey compares to other assessments](https://careerdev.turing.edu/files/Survey%20Comparisons.pdf)
- [Four Essentials of Strengths-Based Leadership](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ekaterinawalter/2013/08/27/four-essentials-of-strength-based-leadership/#76b62a91fa21) (6 minute read)

## Part C: Competencies

As you begin this new chapter of your career, the Career Development team is here to meet you where you are and help you achieve your goals. To help us understand more about your background and comfort levels with each of the 5 competencies, please complete each competency section below. You’ll submit them in the Career Development Mod 0 Project Submission Survey (see [submission directions](#deliverables)). Each competency section should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

### Networking

The first step for networking in your new career as a software developer is to assess the network you currently have. [Please complete this activity](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module-1-prework/networking_prework_activity) and be prepared to share the link to the tracker you create (note: to make your own copy, go to File>Make a Copy). You’ll also respond to these questions in the submission survey:

- Please rate on a scale of 1-4 how easy the networking activity was for you.
    - _On a scale of 1-4, 1 being not easy at all and 4 being very easy, I'd say my ease during the activity was about a 2. Once I got to the second tab and thought about who in my network I would contact and why I struggled a lot._

- As you start at Turing, what are your biggest questions or concerns about networking?
    - _How to do it properly. 😆 I'm great at customer service, and in some ways that is `Networking`, but I'm nervous that it will feel like customer service and that will make me hesitant to do it._

### Interviewing

Whatever your comfort level with interviewing, an effective interview comes down to being able to communicate about who you are. Please prepare responses to these questions to fill into the Submission Survey:

- Tell us about yourself. What is your background? Why are you pursuing a career in software development?
    - _My name is Emily Miles, and I was born and raised in CT. After spending the last 20 years in various customer and hospitality jobs, I decided it was time for a change. I enrolled part-time at my local community college in the Fall of 2019, and have been working toward a degree in Biology, in the hopes of bettering my career options. Since then, I have realized I am more capable than I thought and that I love learning and growing intellectually. After many discussions with people who have careers in the science field, I decided that (despite my love for it) it would take me far too long to get a degree high enough to be able to acquire a job with some financial stability. My sister-in-law, Natalia, took the Turing FE program last year and raved about how much she enjoyed it. So, after many extensive conversations with her, and certain circumstances in my personal life arising, I decided to check out what coding was all about. I did a few free online courses through CodeAcademy and really enjoyed them. Next thing I knew, I was applying for Turing and every step through that process and Mod 0 has reaffirmed that I made the right choice for my life._

- What are your goals for this career?
    - _I want to be able to have a career that pushes me to grow both in and out of the working environment. I'm a creative person by nature, and the idea of working on the creative side of coding is very exciting to me, although I know that might not be where I end up. I also want to find a way to give back and uplift people through my tech career, but am not sure how I will accomplish that just yet._

- As you start at Turing, what are your biggest questions or concerns about interviewing?
    - _My biggest concern about the interviewing process is negotiating a salary that I deserve. I went into depth in the deliverables survey about my past experiences with salary/raise negotiation, and am nervous that I will settle for less than I deserve just because the company I'm applying for says I'm only worth 'x' amount._


### Materials

It’s important for the team to know about each student’s level of experience with job search-related materials. Please prepare responses to these questions to submit in the survey:

- Do you have a LinkedIn profile? If so, how do you currently use it? How frequently do you use it?
    - _Yes, I have a LinkedIn profile but I don't think it's 100% finished. I haven't used it in quite sometime and only used it to see if there were any other jobs listed that weren't on Indeed._

- Have you created a resume before? If so, how confident have you felt about your resume’s effectiveness previously? What questions or concerns do you have about writing a technical resume?
    - _I definitely feel like I could use work in the resume department, but also feel like my current resume's effectiveness is much better than it had been in the past. I have never written a technical resume, and since I still need help with my current resume, I'm nervous about being able to create something that is effective and presents me appropriately._

- Have you written a cover letter for a job posting before? If so, how confident have you felt about your cover letters’ effectiveness previously? What questions or concerns do you have about writing cover letters?
    - _No, I have never written a cover letter before, partially because I did not know how to write one. I want to make sure I have the skills to do these things going forward in my career, so understanding how to properly write a cover letter and resume are my only concerns._

### Job Search Strategies

Please prepare responses to these questions to submit in the survey:

- Describe your approach to job searching in the past. What steps were part of your strategy? What was effective for you? What wasn’t effective for you?
    - _Honestly, I usually just looked for jobs that I was mostly qualified for and that paid more/had better benefits than what I had previously. Almost every job I've had I've been recommended for, as long as they were a step up in some way from my previous job, I thought it was worth it. I've realized none of that has worked out well for me._

- When you think about job searching for a software developer position, what are your biggest questions or concerns?
    - _My biggest concerns are finding a good work/life balance and being able to work in a company that sees and treats me like a human being. And, as I've mentioned a few times before, negotiating a salary that I deserve._


### Negotiations

Please prepare responses to these questions to submit in the survey:

- Have you negotiated for a salary before? If so, what were the results? How did you feel about the experience?
    - _I've negotiated a salary increase and promotion. It did not go well. I went into detail about this in my survey, so I won't recount the whole thing again. Needless to say it was a devastating blow and made me realize even more that I needed to get an education, so I could move on from my current string of customer service jobs._

- When you think about negotiating for a software development position, what are your biggest questions or concerns?
    - _How to appropriately display my talents and abilities, and not settle for something just because it's 'better' than what I've had previously. I want to have a job that I enjoy more days than not, and that can give me financial stability._


# **_NOTE: I had already done and submitted the survey, but after rereading the directions I wasn't sure if I was also supposed to fill everything in within my `repo`, so I opted to do both. That being said, my answers may vary a bit in content and length._**
