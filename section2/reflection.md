## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    - Things that resonated with me:
        1. _You can improve your skills in coding (or any field really), by knowing that it takes effort and practice to grow. You will only get as much out of any situation as you are willing to put into it._
          2. _Don't be afraid to ask for help! Taking the opportunity to learn by asking people in your field clarifying questions on areas you may be struggling with, or just engaging them in discussions about projects, will help you grow and progress within you occupation._
    - Things that were brand new to me or I need to work on:
        1. _S.M.A.R.T. Goals are something new to me and that I very much so plan on utilizing. I've used similar way of completing tasks in my current college classes, but nothing this specific._
        2. _I tend to run more toward the 'if it's not perfect then it's absolute garbage' side of things, and have been diligently working towards improving that, but it's still a struggle. So, trying not to push myself for every little mistake and knowing that mistakes help me learn and grow, is something I will be working on continuously through my career and personal life._

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    - _I guess I kind of answered this question above ðŸ˜… but I think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset by practicing and asking questions. I think I am not good at accepting that I am human and make mistakes and that mistakes help me grow and learn, so I do not think I demonstrate a good Growth Mindset in that regard._

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
    - _It felt fine, actually. I was a little uncomfortable because I thought I missed something, but I worked through it with one of the people in my Mod 0 cohort and then I felt comfortable with it pretty quickly. It definitely helped with getting me more comfortable asking for help in this new field. But overall I'm not super uncomfortable asking questions._

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
    - _Conditionals are pieces of code that uses the variables given to change the output of the code log. A conditional is probably used in probably used in a mobile game like "Choices" since the outcome of how the game proceeds changes depending on the choices you make._
        - Example of a daily life conditional:
        _var coffee = "1"_
        _var withCoffee = "happy!"_
        _var withoutCoffee = "grumpy!"_
        _var tooMuchCoffee = "having a panic attack!"_

        _if (coffee = 1) {_
          _console.log("Emily is " + withCoffee);_ // This will log "Emily is happy!"
        _} else if (coffee > 1) {_
          _console.log(" Emily is " + tooMuchCoffee);_ // This will log "Emily is having a panic attack!"
        _} else {_
          _console.log("Emily is " + withoutCoffee);_ // This will log "Emily is grumpy!"
        _}_

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
    - _By using logical operators you can add multiple conditions together._
        - Example from comparison exercises:
        _var lovesToPlay = true;_
        _var lovesDogPark = false;_
        _var lovesTreats = true;_
        _var age = 1;_

        _// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy_
        _console.log(lovesToPlay && age < 3);_

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
    - _By reviewing the given variables you can figure out which conditional are and are not met within the if/else code block before running the code._

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
    - _None at this time!_
