## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
    - _It felt pretty good. I was able to troubleshoot and find the information I needed with a little googling!_

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
    - _Spotify probably uses arrays within a specific artist's profile and then again within a specific album in that artists profile._

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
    - _Array Methods are commands that allow you to edit the content and length of an array. 'Pop' removes from the end of an array, while 'push' adds to the end of an array. 'Shift' removes from the beginning of an array, while 'unshift' add to the beginning of an array._

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
    - _The purpose of loops is to save time from having to manually type the same command or log over and over again. A loop repeats your code for you. Using an array in conjunction with a loop can allow you to assign specific elements within that array to perform certain tasks. Using an array without a loops you would have to manually assign the elements within that array to the tasks you want them to perform._

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
    - _A loop code is like a toy train set. You can add and remove parts of the train, and once you turn it on you can changes it course but it will only shut down when you tell it to._

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
    - _None at this time!_
