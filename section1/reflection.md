## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
    - _Probably somewhere in between. Though I'm sure there are times I ask questions too soon and also too late. Overall though, I feel good about asking questions. It can be uncomfortable and embarrassing but what can be a moment of discomfort can save hours of stress. I really like the 'Rubber Ducky Debugging' idea! I feel like that is a great way to help you work through an issues on your own._

    **_NOTE: I also answered this in the README.md file so I shorten it a little in this reflection.md file._**

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
    - Strings: _Any data type contained within quotation marks. Letters, words, symbols, or numbers can all be strings, as long as they are contained within quotes._
    - Numbers: _Any data type that is a number not contained within quotations. The numbers can be positive or negative, and can contain decimal points but not commas._
    - Boolean: _Any data type that can evaluate as true or false and is not contained within quotes. Think of it as asking a yes or no question, that is when this data type would used._

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
    - _console.log('Hello World!');_

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
    - _// Double slashes before or after a piece of code are used to indicate comments in JavaScript. The double slashes let the code know that the comment can be 'ignored' when logging the code to the console._

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
    - _A variable is a piece of code that is broad and that can change when you specify it by assigning to a value. So, you can have a variable that is broad like 'toy' and then assign it to a specific type of toy, like legos. But, if you decide that you no longer want to play with legos you can re-assign the variable to a different toy, like hot-wheels._   

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
    - _Instagram probably uses a ton of variables. Such as, hashtags would probably be a string, the number of followers would probably be a number, and the number of likes would probably be a boolean._

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
    - _Concatenation is when you join together multiple different data types and/or variables when you log them to the console._
        - _Example:_
          _var fruit = 'banana'_
          _var veggie = 'spinach'_
          _console.log('Emily likes ' + veggie + ' and ' + fruit + ' smoothies!');_

          _This example joins together the string 'Emily likes ', the variable veggie, the string ' and ', the variable fruit, and the string ' smoothies!'_

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
    - _Also in Instagram, comments with specific people mentioned would probably be a concatenation._

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
    - _I actually feel pretty good about all the material so far. I hit a few snags along the way but that only helped me better understand everything I was working on. So no questions as of right now!_
